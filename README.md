# whazzap
A Python script to send automated replies to unread messages using Whatsapp Web.

Besides sending automated replies, you can search for specific friends/groups also. This comes handy when you've to say sorry to your bae 100 times with an interval of some time or you just want to irritate someone.


Though this has a much higher scope than this and you can use NLTK to automate a reply for every frickin' message.

**NOTE:** It differentiates between group and individuals by looking for the mute sign on the groups. This is because I personally mute every group.
